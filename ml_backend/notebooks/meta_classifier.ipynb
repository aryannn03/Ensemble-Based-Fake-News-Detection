thursday the regional governor said in an attack a senior security source blamed on separatist militants speaking on state tv adolphe lele lafrique governor of the north west region referred to a terrorist attack in the city of bamenda in the western part of the country a senior security source told reuters by telephone the attack was the work of extremists who want independence for the anglophone part of mostly french speaking cameroon if true it would represent a dangerous escalation of a conflict that had thus far pitted only unarmed demonstrators against the security forces the security source said the separatists had also launched other attacks in the past three weeks including burning down several schools today police working in the service of the nation were targeted in a terrorist attack lafrique said this is a new stage in the situation we have been dealing with up until now cameroonians in the english speaking west of the country have over the past year sporadically protested against what they describe as discrimination by the overwhelmingly francophone government of president paul biya a small minority want an independent state which they call ambazonia they

directed against its foes in yemen s armed houthi movement and not civilians yemen has been torn by a civil war in which yemen s internationally recognized government backed by a coalition supported by the united states and britain is trying to roll back the iran aligned houthi group which controls most of northern yemen including the capital sanaa the saudi led coalition s repeated promises to conduct its air strikes lawfully are not sparing yemeni children from unlawful attacks said sarah leah whitson middle east director at human rights watch in a statement this underscores the need for the united nations to immediately return the coalition to its annual list of shame for violations against children in armed conflict she said on august 4 coalition aircraft struck a home in saada killing nine members of a family including six children ages 3 through 12 on july 3 an air strike killed eight members of the same family in taiz province including the wife and 8 year old daughter
